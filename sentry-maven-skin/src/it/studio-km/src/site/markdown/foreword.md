## What's New

**${project.name}** is the newest generation of our well-known monitoring solution. This fully redesigned version has been developed with the most popular front-end and back-end technologies (SPA, AngularJS, BootStrap, REST API, etc.). The full-fledged REST API introduced in this version allows you to query and control the PATROL Agent (get monitored instances and parameters, list events, modify the configuration, etc.).
Interactions with the PATROL Agent and **${project.name}** are now entirely handled through the web-based interface making configuring, managing and troubleshooting operations intuitive and reliable.

While **${project.name}** still offers all the powerful monitoring capabilities of former versions, the Web-based user interface facilitates live interactions with the PATROL Agent and comes with several menus and pages, each dedicated to specific configuration and management operations:

- The **[Console](./console.html)** page displays all the objects discovered by one PATROL Agent and their current status. Additional information is also available when selecting a specific instance or component.

- The **[Events](./events.html)** page, provides details about all the events generated by a PATROL Agent (event severity, occurrence date and time, status, related host, and problem description). You can easily filter events by type or status or retrieve a specific event with the **Search** option. Selecting an event opens the **Event Details** page, where you can add comments, acknowledge, close or delete an event.

- The **[Agent](./agent.html)** menu provides a direct access to the management of the PATROL Agent settings and the configuration of the Java and HTTP Servers properties.

- The **[Studio](./studio-settings.html)** page is dedicated to configuring the monitoring settings for any technology in your environment. Based on a logical hierarchy, each element is configured independently and attached to one another to build a modular set of properties and actions that can be arranged and reused to respond to your monitoring needs.

      The higher level of hierarchy consists in the **Hosts** that provide information about the local or remote target server where the technology that needs to be monitored is installed. **Templates** correspond to the technology you wish to monitor. They can be attached to one or several hosts. Templates contain a set of **Monitors** configured to collect health and performance metrics from the targeted technology or application. A new **Dry Run** feature allows you to challenge your monitoring settings before implementing them to make sure you get the expected output or adjust the configuration if a problem is detected.

- The **[Tools](./tools.html)** menu regroups all the necessary features to facilitate backups, troubleshooting, and advanced configuration operations.

## Important Notice

### BMC Patches

The [BMC patch 11.0.00.01: Patch 1 for BMC PATROL Agent 11.0.00](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/PATROLAgent/110/11-0-00-01-patch-1-for-bmc-patrol-agent-11-0-00-784075031.html) must be installed on PATROL Agent v11.0.00i to use any version of **${project.description}**. Version 11.0.00i of the PATROL Agent on Windows prevents **${project.description}** from operating properly. While apparently successfully loaded, **${project.description}** fails to start and cannot monitor applications.


### Monitoring Studio v8.x, v9.x and ${project.name}

Monitoring Studio v8.x, v9.x and **${project.name}** can run side by side without interfering with each other since their respective configuration and operating files are totally distinct. Note that installing **${project.name}** will not upgrade or uninstall versions 8.x or 9.x.

Configurations created with Monitoring Studio v8.x or v9.x are not compatible with **${project.name}**.
