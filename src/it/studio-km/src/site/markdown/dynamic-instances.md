# Dynamic Object

<div class="alert alert-info">This Monitor is only available from the File, Command Line, HTTP Request, WMI Query, WBEM Query, Database Query, SNMP Polling, PSL Script, and Nagios Plugin Monitors pages.</div>

The purpose of the **Dynamic Object Monitor** is to dynamically create *Monitor* objects based on the **Result** generated by a *parent* [Monitor with content](./content-monitors.html) and create an instance for each line found in the **Result** parameter.

Once the dynamic objects are created, their own **Result** parameter can be analyzed with the [String Search](./content-parsing-monitors.html#StringSearch), [Numeric Value Extraction](./content-parsing-monitors.html#NumericValue) and [Value Map](./content-parsing-monitors.html#ValueMap) Monitors. These Monitors will be instantiated for every instance created at runtime.

Additional instances will be created as soon as new lines appear in the  **Result** parameter of the *parent* Monitor. Similarly, instances will be deleted (or marked as "Missing") when the corresponding lines are no longer present in the **Result** parameter of the *parent* Monitor.

Let's take an example to show how the **Dynamic Object Monitor** works. Imagine that a **Command Line Monitor** returned the following output displayed in the **Result** parameter:

    ID Service Name    Status
    -----------------------------
    @1 BucketListener  OK
    @2 WinCheck        No response
    @3 LnxCheck        OK


We can configure a **Dynamic Object Monitor** with the following settings:

  * **Dynamic Instance Internal ID**: **%{1}** (i.e. the value of the first column of each line)
  * **Dynamic Instance Display Name**: **%{2} (%{1})** (i.e. the value of the second column, and then the value of the first column in parenthesis)
  * **Column Separators**:  *space* and *tab*
  * **Keep Lines Matching**: `^@[0-9]`, meaning that only lines starting with the '@' character and followed by a number will be kept. Any other line, like the title line, will be discarded and no dynamic instance will be created for them.

Based on the output of our command, the **Dynamic Object Monitor**  will dynamically create these *Monitors* at runtime:

| Instance ID | Display Name        | Result Parameter Content        |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| @1          | BucketListener (@1) | `@1 BucketListenener  OK`       |
| @2          | WinCheck (@2)       | `@2 WinCheck       No response` |
| @3          | LnxCheck (@3)       | `@3 LnxCheck       OK`          |

We can report the status of each service with one single **Value Map** Monitor, that will be instantiated for each of the three services at runtime.

Refer to the table below to know how to configure the **Dynamic Object Monitor**:

| Property                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dynamic Instance Internal ID                                        | ID to be used to store the Dynamic Instance Monitor configuration in the PATROL Agent configuration. Use ```%{ColumnNumber}``` to indicate in which column the instance ID can be found.                                                |
| Dynamic Instance Display Name                                       | Object Name to be displayed in TrueSight Operations Management. Use ```%{ColumnNumber}``` to indicate in which column the object name can be found.                                                                                     |
| Column Separator                                                    | Column separator to be considered by ${project.name} to determine the column numbers. You should also specify how adjacent separators and quotes should be considered (marc's comment: it would have been nice to explain this too).                                                                  |
| Display Name                                                        | Name to identify the container that will group all the dynamic objects in TrueSight Operations Management. This Display Name is automatically generated based on the Display Instance Internal ID provided but can be edited if needed. |
| Internal ID                                                         | ID to be used to store the Dynamic Container configuration in the PATROL Agent configuration. This Internal ID is automatically generated based on the Display Name provided but can be edited if needed.                               |
| Keep Lines Matching                                                 | Regular expression to be searched for. Leave blank to consider all lines.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Exclude Lines Matching                                              | Regular expression to be searched for. Each matching line will be ignored.                                                                                                                                                              |
| If Several Lines Have the Same ID                                   | Line(s) to be kept if several lines share the same ID (the first line, the last line, or all lines). The way a line ID is built depends on the value provided in " Dynamic Instances Internal ID". If "all lines" is selected, and several lines have the same value in the column used to build the ID, the Dynamic Instance's Result parameter will contain multiple lines.                                                                                                                                            |
| Remove Missing Dynamic Instance                                     | Specify when missing objects should be automatically removed in the Console.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Report Lines With Identical ID in Template's Collection Error Count | When enabled, a new error will be logged in the Collection Error Count parameter of the template when several lines share the same ID.                                                                                                  |
