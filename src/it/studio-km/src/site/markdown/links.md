## Internal links

[This](index.html) is an internal link.
But [that](#internal-links) is an internal anchor.

## External links

[This](https://onehome.org) links to a beautiful external Web site.
But [that]($project.organization.url) simply links to our own Web site.
And [this one](https://onehome.org) is actually the same as the previous beautiful link!
