# Printing

**${project.name}** ensures the pages are properly rendered when printed:

* No banner
* No navigation menu or links
* Links and URLs are displayed as footnotes
* No fancy colors, for a professional look, and faster printing
* Identical rendering on both US Letter and A4 paper

> **Note**
>
> Print on actual paper only when necessary! The rendering has been polished so you can create a PDF from a page of your documentation.
